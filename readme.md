- Introduction
  Three.js uses the concept of a display list.
  It means that all objects are stored in the list and then drawn to the screen.

- Scene object
  You need to add any object you want to be drawn on the screen to the scene.
  You can have as many scenes as you want, but one renderer can draw only one scene at once
